# Weak Efficient Market Hypothesis Analysis of the Nigeria capital market

In an efficient capital market, security prices adjust quickly to the release of new information into the markets, therefore prices of security reflects all available public information about that security.At any point in time in an efficient market, the security price that prevails is an unbiased reflection of all currently available information, including risk involved in owning the security.

ii) To determine if an active portfolio management strategy or the passive portfolio strategy is best in the Nigeria Capital Market.

# Statistical tool used to test Weak Efficient Market Hypothesis
a) The Serial correlation test(Ljung Box)
Ljung Box is used to test for serial correlation in time series, it test to determine whether a series of observations over time are random and independent. The hypothesis of serial correlation will be accepted if the p value is less than the level of significance.

b) Runs test
The runs test is a non-parametric test used to determine if the sequence of data follows a random process. The run test is based on the number of runs occurring in within the sample, the runs is the sequences of change in the return of the series. Given a series of price changes, each price change is either designated a plus (+)
